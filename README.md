# The-Queen-s-Game

Ludo is a board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single dice.

The Queen's game has two new special features.

The Queen Token
There will be a special token in this game known as the queen token . Compared to the normal tokens, this queen token will have a special power and there will be only 1 queen in the entire board. Whoever  manages to roll a 6 first at the very beginning of this game earns that power.
The Queen's powers include –
. moving back and forth (bi-directional).
. once in the whole game the owner of the queen can decide how many steps the token may advance or recede.

Magical squares
Another one of our features are some special squares on the board, known as the magical squares.
If landed on these squares, the player will be able to choose from  given opportunities-
1. Can roll the dice twice.
2. block one of the opponents from rolling the dice in his next turn.

Timer
To make the game more competitive, each player has to make their move within 15 secs. If they don’t,  then they lose their turn.
