# The-Queen-s-Game

//This is a project that I along with two of my teammates made in freshman year of univerity.


Ludo is a board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single dice.
Rules for LUDO
1. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6.                                                                                    2. The player has to draw a token from home every time he gets a 6 unless home is empty or the start box has 2 own tokens (is doubled).
3. If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player.
4. Players must always move a token according to the dice value rolled. 
5. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the  number of squares indicated by the dice.
6. If the player cannot draw a token from home, rolling a 6 earns the player an additional or "bonus" roll in  that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player  earns again an additional bonus roll. If   the third roll is also a 6, the player may not  move and the turn  immediately passes to the  next player.     
7. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is  returned to its owner's yard. 
8. The returned token can be reentered  into play only when the owner rolls a 6.
9. A player's home column squares are always safe since no opponent may enter     them.  In the home column, you   cannot jump over your token. Roll the exact      number needed to get each token onto the home triangle.

                                                                                
The Queen's game has two new special features.

The Queen Token
There will be a special token in this game known as the queen token . Compared to the normal tokens, this queen token will have a special power and there will be only 1 queen in the entire board. Whoever  manages to roll a 6 first at the very beginning of this game earns that power.
The Queen's powers include –
. moving back and forth (bi-directional).
. once in the whole game the owner of the queen can decide how many steps the token may advance or recede.

Magical squares
Another one of our features are some special squares on the board, known as the magical squares.
If landed on these squares, the player will be able to choose from  given opportunities-
1. Can roll the dice twice.
2. block one of the opponents from rolling the dice in his next turn.

Timer
To make the game more competitive, each player has to make their move within 15 secs. If they don’t,then they lose their turn.
